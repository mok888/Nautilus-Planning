# Progress Log

## 2026-02-12

### Completed Work
- Ran exhaustive `/init-deep` workflow with parallel discovery.
- Collected structure, conventions, anti-patterns, test/build patterns, and boundary markers.
- Scored candidate directories and selected high-value AGENTS locations.
- Updated root `AGENTS.md` and created 7 subdirectory `AGENTS.md` files.
- Reviewed hierarchy for duplication and scope alignment.
- Re-checked and refreshed planning-with-files artifacts on follow-up request.

### Artifacts Added (Planning)
- `task_plan.md`
- `findings.md`
- `progress.md`

### AGENTS Artifacts Updated/Created
- Updated: `AGENTS.md`
- Created:
  - `builder/AGENTS.md`
  - `builder/auth-scraper/AGENTS.md`
  - `builder/templates/AGENTS.md`
  - `builder/snapshots/AGENTS.md`
  - `nautilus-dinger/AGENTS.md`
  - `nautilus-dinger/crates/adapters/AGENTS.md`
  - `nautilus-dinger/nautilus_adapter/adapters/AGENTS.md`

### Validation Notes
- LSP diagnostics unavailable for `.md` in this environment.
- Validation performed via direct readback and hierarchy checks.

### Next Actions (If Requested)
1. Commit AGENTS + planning files.
2. Expand hierarchy further if new modules become complex enough to warrant child docs.
